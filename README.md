## Weather app

Weather application build with React which uses [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) API to display weather information for a particular city as follows: the **main temperature** of the day, **maximum temperature** expected, **minimum temperature** expected, **wind speed** (in m/s), **humidity** in percentages , **cloudiness** in percentages and **amospheric pressure**. All temperatures are displayed in _[Celsius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius)_.

## Features
